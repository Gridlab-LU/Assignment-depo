Modify this jupyter file according to the following problem statement. 


**Maximize Production of 2 Plants**

- \( x_1 \) is the output from plant 1  
- \( x_2 \) is the output from plant 2

---

**Benefit Of Product Plant 1:**  
\( c_1 = 3 \) [$/MWh]

**Benefit Of Product Plant 2:**  
\( c_2 = 5 \) [$/MWh]

---

**The “Objective Function”** expresses the overall benefit to be optimized.  
Our objective function is:

**Maximize:**  
\[
3x_1 + 5x_2
\]

---

### Plant maximum output constraints:

- Maximum Production of Plant 1: \( b_1 = 4 \)
- Maximum Production of Plant 2: \( b_2 = 6 \)

---

**Plants Must Meet an additional inequality constraint:**

\[
3x_1 + 2x_2 \leq 18
\]
